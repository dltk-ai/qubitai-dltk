Training a model
-----------------

Used to train a model on specific data.

.. function:: client.train(service, algorithm, dataset, label, features, model_name=None,
                            lib="weka", train_percentage=80, save_model=True,params=None, 
                            dataset_source=None)

   :param service: Training task to perform. Valid parameter values are classification, regression.
   :param algorithm: Algorithm used for training the model.
   :param dataset: dataset file location in DLTK storage.
   :param label: Target variable.
   :param features: List of features used for training the model.
   :param model_name: Model will be saved with the name specified in this parameter.
   :param lib: Library for training the model. Currently we are supporting scikit, h2o and weka.
   :param train_percentage: Percentage of data used for training the model. Rest of the data will be used to test the model.
   :param save_model: If True, the model will be saved in the DLTK Storage.
   :param dataset_source: To specify data source,
        None: Dataset file from DLTK storage will be used
        database: Query from connected database will be used
   :rtype: A json obj containing the file path in storage.



Predictions
------------

Used to predict data using a model object.


.. function:: client.predict(service, dataset, model_url, features, lib='weka', 
                            params=None, dataset_source=None)
    
    :param service: Service used in training the model. Valid parameter values are classification, regression.
    :param dataset: dataset file location in DLTK storage.
    :param model_url: trained model location in DLTK storage.
    :param features: List of features used for training.
    :param lib: Library used for training the model. Currently we are supporting scikit, h2o and weka.
    :param dataset_source: To specify data source,
        None: Dataset file from DLTK storage will be used
        database: Query from connected database will be used
    :rtype: A json obj containing the file info which has the predictions.



Feedback
---------

Used to retrain a model on new data.

.. function:: client.train(service, algorithm, train_data, feedback_data, job_id, model_url, 
                            label, features, lib='weka', model_name=None, 
                            split_perc=80, save_model=True, params=None):

   :param service: Training task to perform. Valid parameter values are classification, regression.
   :param algorithm: Algorithm used for training the model.
   :param train_data: dataset file location in DLTK storage.
   :param feedback_data: dataset file location in DLTK storage.
   :param job_id: job id from the train function used to train the model.
   :param model_url: model url returned from job output function.
   :param label: Target variable.
   :param features: List of features used for training the model.
   :param lib: Library for training the model. Currently we are supporting scikit, h2o and weka.
   :param model_name: Model will be saved with the name specified in this parameter.
   :param split_perc: Percentage of data to use for training the model. Rest of the data will be used to test the model.
   :param save_model: If True, the model will be saved in DLTK Storage.
   :param params: additional parameters.
   :rtype: A json obj containing the file path in storage.
